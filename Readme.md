## Queerly Positive API

### What is Queerly Positive?

Queerly Positive is a positive news application that aims to provide a safe and uplifting space for the LGBTQ+ community. It curates and showcases positive news stories, articles, and content related to the LGBTQ+ community, promoting inclusivity, acceptance, and celebration of diversity.

### How the API Works

Using JavaScript, Express, and MongoDB, we have a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API that follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. The API uses a Model, Routes, and a Controller to handle data operations.
